[Network Design]
- Make links able to be dragged
- menu for buttons (maybe add a right click function to the workspace)
- Hypervisor Device
- Make it able to click into a hypervisor and add VMs in there (Going to show up with a new empty workspace)
once you leave it, it will show the previous workspace again (Creating this virtual enviorment and physical enviroment)
- Edit colors on page to be more easy to see even with darker screens.
